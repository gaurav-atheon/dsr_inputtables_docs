Demand Signal Repository (DSR)
===============================================================

The Demand Signal Repository (DSR) is the core of the DeSiRe platform.
Demand signals are any piece of information that may help us better understand
demand for product. The repository is the central place we store the signals.

The DSR's purpose is to:
    - Define and harmonise demand signals
    - Consolidate data from multiple sources
    - Provide a consistent way of modelling the retail supply chain
    - Support analytical understanding of the data
